ENGO 551 - Adv. Topics on Geospatial Technologies

All the files in the repo are created for project0. The topic chosen for this project, is a personal introduction of the author. This file is a reference for the files inside the folder. There are five main files available: index.html, earlylife.html, education.html, hobbies.html, and stylesheet.scss. The four html files contain webpages of personal information. As these webpages are only created for the sake of the project, they are not content-rich. Components of these pages are only placed to demonstrate different stylings on them. The scss file contains the stylesheet of the webpages. It is noteworthy that index.html uses Bootstrap 4, while others do not utilize it. Also, index.html acts as the homepage. Other pages only host a few information regarding their naming.

Thank you for your attention,
Mahdi
