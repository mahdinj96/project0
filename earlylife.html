    <h2> Early Life

    </h2>

    <body>
      I was born in Tehran. At 2 years old, we moved to Germany. Therefore, I have spent 6 years of my childhood there. I went to school there and studied until the 3rd grade. We then moved back to Tehran and I remained there until now that I moved to Calgary.
